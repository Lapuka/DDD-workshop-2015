Welcome to the DDD2015 GitHub. Here you can find all the work done by the team during and after the workshop.

Basic Usage:

After cloning the repo locally on your computer and opening with Unity 5, you will find yourself with the following 
file structure:

- _TEMP		(contains standard assets required by unity for all the components to work)
- Experimental	(contains models and assets that still need work to get to a workable state)
- Oculus	(Oculus Rift assets)
- OVR		(Oculus Runtime)
- Prefabs	(Models and materials imported from Revit)
- Scripts	(Ready to use scripts created, working but with minimum testing)

To get started, open the file "Scene1" found in the "Assets" directory from your file explorer or from Unity 5.

This file contains the basic scene with a terrain, Revit model and a working character in order to explore.


REMINDER: in order to use the experimental 3D motion character swap the "inputManager.asset" file in the ProjectSettings
folder with the "inputManager_controller.asset".
